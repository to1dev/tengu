//! Base class for the \c Task<T> promise_type.
/*!
 * This is a promise_type for a Task<T> returned from a coroutine. When a coroutine
 * is constructed, it looks at its return type, which will be \c Task<T>, and constructs
 * new object of type \c Task<T>::promise_type (which will be \c TaskPromise<T>). Using
 * \c TaskPromise<T>::get_return_object() it obtains a new object of Task<T>. Then the
 * coroutine user code is executed and runs until the it reaches a suspend point - either
 * a co_await keyword, co_return or until it reaches the end of user code.
 *
 * You can think about promise as an interface that is callee-facing, while Task<T> is
 * an caller-facing interface (in respect to the current coroutine).
 *
 * Promise interface must provide several methods:
 *  * get_return_object() - it is called by the compiler at the very beginning of a coroutine
 *    and is used to obtain the object that will be returned from the coroutine whenever it is
 *    suspended.
 *  * initial_suspend() - it is co_awaited by the code generated immediately before user
 *    code. Depending on the Awaitable that it returns, the coroutine will either suspend
 *    and the user code will only be executed once it is co_awaited by some other coroutine,
 *    or it will begin executing the user code immediately. In case of QCoro, the promise always
 *    returns std::suspend_never, which is a standard library awaitable, which prevents the
 *    coroutine from being suspended at the beginning.
 *  * final_suspend() - it is co_awaited when the coroutine co_returns, or when it reaches
 *    the end of user code. Same as with initial_suspend(), depending on the type of Awaitable
 *    it returns, it either suspends the coroutine (and then it must be destroyed explicitly
 *    by the Awaiter), or resumes and takes care of destroying the frame pointer. In case of
 *    QCoro, the promise returns a custom Awaitable called TaskFinalSuspend, which, when
 *    co_awaited by the compiler-generated code will make sure that if there is a coroutine
 *    co_awaiting on the current corutine, that the co_awaiting coroutine is resumed.
 *  * unhandled_exception() - called by the compiler if the coroutine throws an unhandled
 *    exception. The promise will store the exception and it will be rethrown when the
 *    co_awaiting coroutine tries to retrieve a result of the coroutine that has thrown.
 *  * return_value() - called by the compiler to store co_returned result of the function.
 *    It must only be present if the coroutine is not void.
 *  * return_void() - called by the compiler when the coroutine co_returns or flows of the
 *    end of user code. It must only be present if the coroutine return type is void.
 *  * await_transform() - this one is optional and is used by co_awaits inside the coroutine.
 *    It allows the promise to transform the co_awaited type to an Awaitable.
